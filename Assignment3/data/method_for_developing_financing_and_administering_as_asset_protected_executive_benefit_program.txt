Method for developing, financing and administering as asset protected executive benefit program . A method is provided for developing, financing and administering an asset-protected executive benefit. An employer or Investor makes an investment in an LLC whereby the employer or Investor becomes the preferred, non-managing member and is entitled to receive a guaranteed payment plus pre-established rate of return. An Executive also makes an investment in the same LLC, becomes a non-preferred, managing member and is entitled to receive value created by the LLC in excess of the amount paid to the preferred member. The LLC invests in, owns, and is the beneficiary of two life insurance policies; a Preferred Policy designed to have a death benefit equal to the investment plus cumulative guaranteed return to the preferred member, and an Investment Policy designed to meet the long-term investment objectives of the members. The Executive may instruct the LLC to borrow against the Investment Policy from which the Executive receives a cash distribution.
